HR Employee Attrition Analysis
==============================

📌 Project Overview
-------------------
This project analyzes an HR dataset of 1,500+ employee records to uncover insights related to employee attrition. 
The dataset includes demographics, salaries, job roles, and work experience. 
The goal is to identify the key factors contributing to attrition and present actionable insights through data cleaning, 
SQL analysis, and visualization using Tableau/Power BI.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies
-----------------------
- Excel → Data cleaning, preprocessing, and quick analysis
- SQL → Data extraction, transformations, and queries
- Tableau / Power BI → Dashboard creation and visualization

------------------------------------------------------------

🔑 Key Steps
------------
1. Data Preparation
   - Removed duplicates and missing values
   - Standardized categorical fields (e.g., Gender, Yes/No responses)
   - Structured salary and experience data for consistency

2. SQL Analysis
   - Queries for attrition by department, job role, and age group
   - KPIs such as attrition rate, average salary, and employee count
   - Trend analysis on years at company vs. attrition

3. Visualization (Tableau/Power BI)
   - KPI Cards: Total Employees, Attrition Rate, Avg Salary
   - Bar Chart: Attrition by Department
   - Stacked Column Chart: Attrition by Job Role & Gender
   - Line Chart: Attrition by Years at Company
   - Donut Chart: Attrition by Age Group

------------------------------------------------------------

📊 Key Insights
---------------
- Higher attrition observed among employees with lower salaries and shorter tenure
- Certain job roles (e.g., Sales & Support) showed higher turnover rates
- Mid-age groups displayed lower attrition compared to early-career employees

------------------------------------------------------------

🚀 Outcomes
-----------
- Improved understanding of employee retention challenges
- Identified focus areas such as compensation strategy and role-specific retention policies
- Provided management with a dashboard for real-time HR insights
